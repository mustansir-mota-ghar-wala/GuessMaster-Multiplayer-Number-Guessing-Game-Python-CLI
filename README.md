🧠 How the Game Works The user enters the number of players. Each player enters their name. A random number is generated for each player. The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number. The program records the number of attempts. The winner is determined based on the minimum number of attempts. If two or more players have equal minimum attempts, the result is declared a draw.
